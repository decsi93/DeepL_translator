A GUI application that uses DeepL's API to translate documents, the main target is to be able to mass-translate documents even for less technical users hence the GUI, can be used to put watermarks on the documents, that support it (_.docx, .pptx, .xlsx, .pdf, .html_), however at this time only _.pdf_ files can be equipped with a watermark because I yet to implement the rest.
Currently, I am in the works of separating the GUI from the main translator part, so that it's more readable.
In the future, I want to make a web app using Django 

If you want to use the most up-to-date version it's usually gonna be the "work" branch, which is broken right now because I forgot to update the main branch to the latest stable version, so yeah...
