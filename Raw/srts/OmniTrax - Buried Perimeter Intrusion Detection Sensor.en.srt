00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,739
OmniTrax is a leading buried 
cable intrusion detection sensor.

2
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:15,035
The best coverage is achieved when the  

3
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:19,040
transmitting and receiving cables 
are buried one to two meters apart,  

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,032
creating an invisible radar-like detection 
field of about three meters wide.

5
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:31,400
If an intruder disrupts the electromagnetic field  

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,629
it will cause an alarm with accurate 
location to the nearest one meter.

7
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:45,865
A single OmniTrax processor covers two 
segments, each of these up to 400 meters.

8
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:50,870
For longer perimeters processors can be networked.

9
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,949
The sensor cables can also provide power and data.

10
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:01,940
OmniTrax is completely covert and 
therefore extremely difficult to defeat.

11
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:10,776
The detection accuracy enables precise 
pointing of a camera to the suspected location.

12
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:33,350
OmniTrax is a terrain-following covert 
sensor and extremely difficult to defeat.

13
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:34,479
With accurate locating, it is a high 
security sensor, ideal for maintaining  

14
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:47,263
site aesthetics or as part of an integrated 
perimeter intrusion detection system.
