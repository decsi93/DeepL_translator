1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,579
FiberPatrol, from Senstar, is a high-performance
fiber optic perimeter intrusion detection

2
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:09,259
system.

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,259
 

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:15,059
With its extended coverage distance and precision
ranging, FiberPatrol is ideal for protecting

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,360
critical sites and infrastructure.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,770
Software-defined zones with independent detection
settings enable a single sensor cable to detect

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,990
activity across a mix of applications, including
chainlink, welded mesh and pallisade fences,

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,990
wall tops, buried perimeter, buried pipeline
interference, and data conduits. 

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,820
FiberPatrol locates intrusions to within a
few meters.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,590
Adaptive signal processing combined with experiential
intelligence immediately detects and locates

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:42,120
intrusions, providing security staff with
enhanced situational awareness and precise

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,120
camera pointing capabilities.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,629
The fiber optic sensor is lightning and EMI
immune, intrinsically safe in explosive environments,

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,810
and contains no in-infield electrical components.

15
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,720
FiberPatrol technology works by measuring
the Rayleigh backscattering of highly coherent

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,479
laser light along the fiber, enabling the
precise detection and locating of any disturbance.

17
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,670
In addition, the system offers cut-immunity,
in which the full perimeter remains protected

18
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,939
in the event of a cable cut. 

19
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,529
Multi-layered signal processing, including
environmental disaggregation alongside environmentally

20
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:27,049
derived adaptive processing technology (EDAPT),
enables FiberPatrol to detect intrusion attempts

21
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:32,560
while filtering out noise from environmental
conditions like wind or rain, virtually eliminating

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,729
nuisance alarms that may overload the ability
of the security staff to respond.

23
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:43,729
The FiberPatrol sensor unit includes all necessary
detection and gateway software, and supports

24
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,340
certified integrations with industry ~~leading~~-leading
security software.

25
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:55,990
An open, freely available SDK ensures FiberPatrol
can be easily added to any security system.

26
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:02,020
Part of a comprehensive portfolio of security
products, FiberPatrol is backed by worldwide

27
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:12,109
technical support from a security company
trusted for over 40 years.
