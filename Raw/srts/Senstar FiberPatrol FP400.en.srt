00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,020
The Senstar FiberPatrol FP400 is a fence-mounted
fiber optic sensor

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,239
that detects perimeter intrusions.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,899
With 4 separate detection zones, the FP400
is an affordable solution for smaller sites

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,009
where EMI, lightning or in-field electrical
components are a concern.

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,060
The lightweight fiber optic sensor cable is
attached directly to the fence fabric.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,140
Any attempt to cut, climb, or otherwise break
through the fence disturbs the transmitted

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,890
signal and an alarm is generated.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:40,450
The FP400 works on most fence types, including
chainlink, welded mesh, and palisade.

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,909
The processor is outdoor-rated and can be
installed in a variety of locations to meet

10
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,690
deployment requirements.

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,079
For example, it can be installed outside along
the perimeter itself, or placed in a central

12
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,839
secure location and connect to the perimeter
via non-sensing lead-in cable.

13
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:03,069
As part of Senstar’s family of perimeter
protection solutions, the FP400 is easy to

14
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:08,410
set up and works with Senstar’s entire suite
of software for configuration, integration,

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,410
and alarm display.

16
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,330
Field-proven integrations for industry-standard
security and video management systems are

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,539
available, minimizing training requirements.

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,430
Designed by the world leader in perimeter
intrusion detection systems, the FiberPatrol

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,000
FP400 is an affordable, effective way to protect
smaller sites.
