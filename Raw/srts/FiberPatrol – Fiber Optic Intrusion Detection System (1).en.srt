00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,500
we are proud to present our newest state

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,720
of the art fiber sensor for long

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,820
perimeters with accurate intrusion

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,070
location a single processor with a

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,379
standard fiber cable can protect long

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,810
perimeters these could be different

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,170
types of physical barriers such as

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,410
welded mesh

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,960
Jean link fence

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,250
top walls

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,890
and buried pipelines the technology

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,050
leverages the phenomena that when light

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,210
travels in a fiber a fraction of the

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,910
photons scatter back to the source this

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,500
return carries valuable information

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,769
regarding intrusions the processor acts

17
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,050
like radar pulses of light are

18
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,300
transmitted and in between back

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,979
scattered energy is measured and

20
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,440
displayed correlated to the time of

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,440
travel when the fiber is static the

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,920
display shows no spikes an intrusion

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,410
would shake a section of the fiber and a

24
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,539
spike would show due to the change in

25
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:11,399
the nature of the back scattered energy

26
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:14,130
a redundant configuration with

27
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,630
Streamlight clockwise and

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,020
counterclockwise simultaneously enabling

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,600
full functionality even if the cable is

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,899
cut the extended range system for

31
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:25,530
pipelines

32
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,479
minimizes the number of infrastructure

33
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,729
locations where equipment needs to be

34
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,159

location of intruders detects multiple

36
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,399
simultaneous intrusions no need for

37
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,640
outdoor power or electronics EMI and

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,789

39
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,940
installation and self-healing in case of

40
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,330
a fiber cut fiber Patrol an innovative

41
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,119
security solution for airports borders

42
