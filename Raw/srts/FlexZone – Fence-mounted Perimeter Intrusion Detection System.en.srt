00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:08,009
A fence around the perimeter of a secured site is only a minor deterrent for determined intruders.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,540
The FlexZone fence sensor brings intrusion detection out to the perimeter,

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,119
protecting against trespassing vandalism and theft while helping to meet security requirements.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,720
FlexZone is a fence-mounted perimeter intrusion detection system

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:28,080
that detects and locates attempts to cut climb or otherwise break through a perimeter fence.

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,739
FlexZone combines many of the most advanced security features into a single cost-effective solution.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,319
Unlike less advanced solutions on the market, FlexZone uses software-defined zones.

9
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,529
Each processor supports up to 60 zones,

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,179
all independently adjustable and readily integrated with cameras for complete coverage.

11
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:56,339
FlexZone covers 2,000 feet or 600 meters per processor and locates intrusions within 10 feet or 3 meters,

12
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:03,119
industry-leading performance at a fraction of the cost. The system provides security staff with enhanced

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,629
situational awareness and precise camera pointing capabilities.

14
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,199
FlexZone uses adaptive algorithms to detect

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,569
simultaneous intrusion attempts while filtering out noise from environmental conditions like wind or rain,

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,628
virtually eliminating nuisance alarms that may overload the ability of the security staff to respond.

17
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:27,960
FlexZone can be installed on almost any fence type including chain-link welded mesh and palisade.

18
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,600
Installation is simple: with FlexZone a single cable carry sensor data,

19
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,849
networking and power and can be quickly installed on the fence by non specialized personnel.

20
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:43,828
Ruggedized for the outdoors, FlexZone works even in the most extreme weather conditions.

21
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:51,929
FlexZone is compatible with more than 20 third-party solutions and is easily added to any existing security system.

22
00:01:52,570 --> 00:02:00,000
