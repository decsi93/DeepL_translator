00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,840
The Senstar LM100 is the world's first
intelligent perimeter lighting and

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,730
sensing solution. The luminaire combines
high-performance LED lighting with

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,189
intrusion detection sensors. A powerful
deterrent the LM100 detects and

4
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,189
illuminates intruders at the fence line
simple to install the Senstar LM100

5
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,240
enhances your perimeter security, while
saving you money by reducing operational

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,579
costs and protecting against break-ins.
The LM100 is designed to protect any

7
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,719
property or site with perimeter security
requirements. It can be used as a

8
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,170
standalone system or in conjunction with
CCTV cameras and other security products

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,219
uniform illumination of the fence line
helps CCTV cameras to avoid bright spots,

10
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,770
while high color rendering index LEDs
ensure colors are not washed out.

11
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,449
Built-in sensors notify your security
system of any attempt to cut, climb, lift

12
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,880
or break the fence fabric. The lights can
follow a pre-programmed schedule as well

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,640
as turn on or strobe whenever intrusion
attempts are detected.

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,300
Wireless networking eliminates the need to install communication cabling along the

15
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,390
fence. It forms a self-healing mesh
ensuring that the system remains

16
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,920
operational if some of the luminaires
are damaged. A low-voltage device, the LM100

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,020
is easy and safe to install, and the
downward directed coverage pattern

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,270
minimizes light pollution. Using only 2.5
watts per luminaire the ultra

19
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,640
energy-efficient LM100 reduces
electricity costs by as much as 95% when

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,600
compared to other security lighting
products.

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,130
Built by Senstar, the world leader in
perimeter intrusion detection systems

22
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,839
the Senstar LM100 combines two
security technologies into a single

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,890
system. It is an affordable effective way
to protect any property.
