00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,980
invisible electromagnetic field of

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,690
energy is created between the

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,359
transmitter and receiver digital signal

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,970
processing algorithms analyze changes in

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,830
the field and distinguish intruders

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,310
effects ultra-wave provides a low

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,349
nuisance alarm rate while maintaining a

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,230
high probability of detection to protect

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,610
against deliberate spoofing or

16
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,070
accidental misalignment the ultra wave

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,710
receiver unit only recognizes its paired

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,360
transmitter unit through a unique

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,190
microwave communication channel between

20
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,129
the devices this communications channel

21
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,079
reduces infrastructure costs by

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,000
eliminating the need to run networking

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,610
cable to the transmitter unit with 10

options for frequency channels

25
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,329
ultra-wave pairs can be deployed

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,850
individually or stacked together to

27
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,530
increase the height of the detection

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,510
the ultra wave has been designed for and

30
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,880
tested in harsh outdoor environments and

standards security and video management

36
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,320
systems are available minimizing
